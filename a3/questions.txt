Answer 1
--------
Generally all all operations that are permitted on files are 
permitted on devices (since UNIX treats devices as files).


Answer 2
--------
vfs_getcurdir() increases the reference count of the current directory because
it is passing a reference to the directory out to the program, and since the
reference is going to be used later on, it's use is not complete (and that
is why VOP_DECREF is not called on it inside vfs_getcurdir(), thus it is 
the responsibility of the function calling vfs_getcurdir() to decrease 
the reference count after it's done using it, like in vfs_getcwd()).


Answer 3
--------
The devices are added to the list via calls to vfs_adddev().


Answer 4
--------
The VOP_ routines that work on a file (as an abstraction)  whereas the FSOP_ routines work on the filesystem (as an abstraction).

Answer 5
--------
This is because the SFS maintains a copy of the freemap and superblock in 
memory and works on it, syncing it before unmounting (and shutdown).

Answer 6
--------
This means that if the computer crashes before the SFS has been synced, then
the file system will be in an inconsistend (and possibly unusable) state.
