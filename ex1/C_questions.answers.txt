Question 1
==========

Since the function strlen returns an unsigned integer, so when we get the 
length of an empty string, it is 0. Now when we subtract 1 from it in the
second function, the unisgned integer overflows and causes the loop to read
past the string endiing, eventually causing a segfault.
