Answer 1
--------
Generally all all operations that are permitted on files are 
permitted on devices (since UNIX treats devices as files).


Answer 2
--------
vfs_getcurdir() increases the reference count of the current directory because
it is passing a reference to the directory out to the program, and since the
reference is going to be used later on, it's use is not complete (and that
is why VOP_DECREF is not called on it inside vfs_getcurdir(), thus it is the responsibility of the function calling vfs_getcurdir() to decrease the reference count after it's done using it, like in vfs_getcwd())
