A1: Threading and Synchronization

General Correctness (5)
2 : Disk statistics are maintained and correctly displayed (2)
1 : nanosleep simulates delay correctly (1)
1 : The steps for an individual call to read_block and write_block are correct.(2)

Synchronization Design (6)
1.5 : design.txt -- clean design for a read request that hits (2)
1.5 : design.txt -- clean design for an eviction (2)
2 : Concurrency is not significantly constrained by synch in file table (2)

Synchronization Implementation (8)
2 : Only one disk op is permitted at a time (2)
2 : More than one cache block may be read or written at a time (2)
3 : No deadlocks (4)

Style (4)
2 : Return values on critical section calls checked (2)
2 : Generally good programming style in terms of modularity and readability. (2)

Presentation (2)
1 : Clear description of how the synchronization problems were solved. (1)
1 : Answered questions well about the code. (1)

0 : deduction for compiling with warnings. (-2.5)
22 : Total (25)
0 : Grace days used


Feedback:
- Too much code to populate timespec. Try msec/1000, msec%1000 instead
- Lock cache slot *before* you unlock file
- Document high-level details instead of a code rundown
