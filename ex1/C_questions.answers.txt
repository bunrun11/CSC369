Question 1
==========

Since the function strlen returns an unsigned integer, so when we get the 
length of an empty string, it is 0. Now when we subtract 1 from it in the
second function, the unisgned integer overflows and causes the loop to read
past the string endiing, eventually causing a segfault.

Question 2
==========
  A: p is a pointer to a pointer to an int
  Declaration: int **p

  B: p is an integer
  Declaration: int p

  C: p is a structure
  Declaration: struct thread p

  D: p is a pointer to a character
  Declaration: char *p

  E: p is a pointer to a function that accepts an int and char **
  Declaration: int (*p)(int, char **)

  F: p is an unsigned short
  Declaration: u_int16_t p

  G: printf returns an int
  Declaration: int p

  H: (3, 4.2) evaluates to 4.2
  Declaration: double p

  I: p is of type u_int32_t
  Declaration: u_int32_t p

  J: p is a pointer to u_int32_t
  Declaration: u_int32_t *p
