Exercise 1: Pointers and Threading

Type exercise
3: Signed and Unsigned Integers (4)
 -- 1 for pointing out that an unsigned integer - 1 is a large number.
 -- 2 points for a complete description of (a) why garbage is printed or (b) why the seg fault occurs.
 -- 1 point for a description of the other.

KR: Why does the seg fault occur?

10: Type questions (10)
 -- 1 point each.
A. int **
B. int
C. struct thread
D. char *
E. function pointer or "int*(int, char**)"
F. unsigned short
G. int
H. float/double
I. u_int32_t (or unsigned int)
J. u_int32_t *

2: Macro questions (6)
 -- 1 point each for an expansion
 -- 1 point for a description of the final value. For "A" this involves a description of the "&" operator; for "C", the comma operator and function pointer.

KR: "&" is the bitwise and operator not a cast (-2)
KR: B - so what is the value?
KR: Explain in detail (-2)

Thread exercise
2: Makefile compiles code (2)
2: Style: Code compiles without warnings (2)
2: Style: Error handling implemented (2)
 -- 1 point for error handling on the command line args.
 -- 1 point for checking at least a few system call return values. 
2: Ordering implemented correctly; does not rely on timing (2)
2: Main thread joins with children (2)

25: Total (30)
