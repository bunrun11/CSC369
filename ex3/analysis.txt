Environment
-----------
A Virtual Machines under VirtualBox with:
  * 32 MB of Memory
  * 7513 MB of Disk Space
  * 556 MB of Swap
  * ArchLinux x86 with Kernel 2.6.35

Rationale
---------
I decided to run the tests under a VM, because I could control how much
memory was available to the system and thus compare and contrast between a
small and large dataset under a reasonable amount of time.

Since modern CPUs also support hardware based virtualization, the
running time of the tests was pretty close to what I got outside the VM.

The VM video adapter took off 8 MB of RAM, and the base Arch install was using
around 23 MB, thus the application effectively had a megabyte of free space
which helped in seeing a significant difference in the datasets.

Tests
-----
I wrote a shell script[pageTest.sh] that ran the 'testheap' and 'testbh' 
tests for a various number of operations.

I also made the script change the DATASIZE after each set was completed.

The tested values were:
  * DATASIZEs of 8 16 32 64 128 and 256
  * Operations of 10k 50k 100k and 500k

I ran the test 3 times for each DATASIZE/num_ops combo to take into
account if the system was under heavy stress or other factors.
