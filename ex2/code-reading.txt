Q2: Under dumbvm a page is 4096 bytes and each process gets 12 pages for it's user-level stack.

Q3: The function 'as_copy' is used to create an exact copy of an address space.

Q4: The function 'mi_threadstart' is the entrypoint for new threads. 

Q5: OS/161 provides semaphores, locks and condition variables.

Q6: The error 'EINVAL' should be generated when a system call is invoked with invalid arguments.

Q7: The syscall number for execv is 1 (SYS_execv).

Q8: The file 'kern/main/main.c' contains the machine independent code for the 'sys_reboot' call.

The file 'kern/dev/lamebus/lamebus.c' contains the 'lamebus_poweroff' function which contains the actual machine dependent code that does the reboot.

Q9: If you change a header file then you will have to run 'make' and 'make install' again.

Q10: If you add a new header, then you will have to reconfigure and re-compile. Thus you'll have to re-run everything i.e. ./config, make depend, make and make install
